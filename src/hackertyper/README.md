# HackerTyper

A simple HackerTyper web application made with React and React hooks for state
management. Application listens for keyDown events and according to which key was
pressed, it either continues with slicing sample text, shows "Access Granted" on
"shift" key press, "Access Denied" on "ctrl" key press or resets state of
the whole application with "ESC". For styling I used Emotion Styled Components.
